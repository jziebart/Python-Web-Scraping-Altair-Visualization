# Python-Web-Scraping-Altair-Visualization
Using Python to scrape posted Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) data and generate Altair scatter plots

Overview:
- The client needed visualizations of 2021 AQHI data from three select communities in Ontario, Canada to inform discussions about the impact of wildfire smoke on worker respiratory health.
- Current year data was not yet availible to download in a spreadsheet so web scraping was necessary before creating visual representations.
- Altair scatterplots were created for Barrie, North Bay, and Thunderbay communities where AQHI-related sensors were availible and actively providing observations each day.

Tools:
- Use of Python3, Pandas library, and Altair within a Jupyter notebook.
